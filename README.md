# My resumé:

This is my personal resumé built with [sveltejs](https://github.com/sveltejs) located on [GitHub Pages](https://perjansson.github.io)

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build:prod
```
